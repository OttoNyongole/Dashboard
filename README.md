# Dashboard
Building a Strategic Decision Dashboard
High-Level Vision (What We're Building):
- Core UI: Clean, card-based layout (like the screenshots) with navigation (Dashboard, Analysis, Collaboration).
- Key Sections:
  - Header: Title, date, user info, online status.
  - Top Metrics: Active Decisions, Urgent Items, Team Members, System Health.
  - KPIs: Cards for Quarterly Revenue (with progress bar), Strategic Initiatives, Decision Velocity, Risk Score, Team Collaboration, Market Position.
  - Recent Activity: Feed of events (e.g., "Market Expansion updated", with urgency badges).
- Interactivity: Filters, refresh buttons, hover tooltips.
- AI Layer (Later): Integrate Gemini for predictions/risks, Perplexity for market insights.
- Data: Start with fake CSV/JSON, evolve to Supabase-like DB.
